# ML-matrix-completion
Low-rank Matrix Completion via Deep Neural Networks. <br>
[submitted as a project for Machine Learning for Physicists and Mathematicians Summer School 2025]<br>
The project was done in the span of 4 days for the summer school. I will be back to the project later since there are many questions and modifications I wish to explore. <br>
Please note that more fine-tuning is needed for optimal prediction. Therefore, it's not advisable to use the uploaded pre-trained models.
